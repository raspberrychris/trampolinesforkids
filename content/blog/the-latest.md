Here we are learning how to use hugo's pipes eg ".Reverse" keyword in this case

```golang
{{ range (where .Pages.ByDate "Section" "blog").Reverse }}
```

## Such a Nice Picture on top of

This is an itroductory post to the topic of table of contents. you see we used a conditional statement to choose whether this post has a table of content.

Just a word above 400 and voila we have a table of.

Also notice the Table of cotent (TOC) set to true in the front matter.

### More Dummy Content - Part 1

mple, at Toys “R” Us,
having the“hot” toy of the season in stock, a nonnumerical condition, catapults
sales. The in-stock condition could be indicated in a data set by a “I”
and out-of-stock condition could be designated by a “0,” using dummy

### More Dummy Content - Part 2

and out-of-stock condition could be designated by a “0,” using dummy

## The Statistic Measure of Reliability

The T statistic can help determine if the regression equation calculated by the spreadsheet is a good one to use for forecasting.

The T statistic reveals if an X variable has a statistically significant effect on Y, such as temperature’s
effect on sales.

You calculate the measure by dividing the X coefficient by
its “Standard Error.” The rule of thumb says if a T statistic is above 2 or below
/minus;2, the X variable has a statistically significant effect on Y.

In our case
16,431/3,367 = 4.88, a very high T-stat. Therefore, an analyst would conclude
that temperature is a very good predictor of sales.
When considering whether a model is a good forecaster, it is necessary to have both a high R Square and a high T statistic. It is possible to create a
model with more than one X variable. This is called multivariable regression.

As the number of variables increases, so does the R Square. However, adding
more X variables with low T statistics creates an inaccurate model.

It is necessary
to play with the model, adding and dropping independent variables to achieve high R Squares and high T statistics.

## Dummy Variable Regression Analysis

A trick employed in regression analysis is the use of dummy variables to represent conditions that are not measured in a numerical series. Ones and
zeroes are used to represent these conditions. For example, at Toys “R” Us,
having the“hot” toy of the season in stock, a nonnumerical condition, catapults
sales. The in-stock condition could be indicated in a data set by a “I”
and out-of-stock condition could be designated by a “0,” using dummy
variables.

Given a hypothetical set of data at a Toys “R” Us store, you can see how
it works.
